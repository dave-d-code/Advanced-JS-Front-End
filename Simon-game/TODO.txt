Build the simple simon game.

Site displays a series of lighted buttons, which you have to follow the pattern.

Some thoughts.

Computer ARRAY to record the sequence, (at random)

Player ARRAY to record the player sequence. Then compare the arrays at each position. Button 1,2,3 4 etc.

array length for number of moves.

Start with the physical output of the array sequence, with 4 buttons. See if can make dynamic selector in Jquery for the response. doable.

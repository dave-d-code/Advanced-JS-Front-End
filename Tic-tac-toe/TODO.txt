Build the game of tic tac toe in JS.

Some thoughts.

1. How to represent the game panel in JS. Maybe as an array, with 3 arrays inside.

2. Some possible AI features? at first, just use available random placements, then add AI later if you can.

3. Rules for winning. maybe x == 1 and O == 2. Empty places will need to be filled in with zero.

Have to find best method to loop thru both sets of arrays to find empty spot. also same fun to output the
actual display in a different function.

4. Need function to loop thru the array set. perhaps objects might help here. array[0][1].value??

5. draw out array diagram and find out clever way to see if win.. will need a "check win function"

if (array[i][0] == array[i][1] && ...) or can you chain 3 together.. sandbox if you can do a == b == c

AI rules.

1. loop throug to see if winning posn
2. go for the middle
3. go for the corners
4. pick anywhere

Start with the array first, then add interactivity last. doable.
